a numpy implementation of J. Magland and A. Barnett, [Unimodal clustering using isotonic regression: ISO-SPLIT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04841).

incomplete, unofficial, and in no way endorsed by those authors. see the [official implementation](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/isosplit5). this code is (or, will be) a direct translation to Python of the MATLAB implementation there.

depends on `scikit-learn` in addition to numpy for the isotonic regression.
